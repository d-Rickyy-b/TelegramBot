# TelegramBot
This is the code for my Telegram Bot. You can find it here: https://telegram.me/BlackJackBot

The main file is - as the name already says - main.py
You need to put your API-Token in the right place.

It fetches updates once a second.

The bot has a command "!ip" to get the IP from inside the bot. If you don't want that feature, comment the line. If you want it you need a script returning the IP. I will uploade one, if you request it.
